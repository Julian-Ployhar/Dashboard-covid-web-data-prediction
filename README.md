# covid-web-data-predictor

This repository hosts the Jupyter Notebook Northwell Health used to create a predictor of Covid cases by using Northwell.edu web traffic data.

This repository is meant to be a jumping off point for others who would like to attempt to give an early indicator of Covid cases in their respective hospital system. 

To apply to another health system it is expected that the majority of the time would be feature engineering of another systems URL-pathting that would categorize web traffic into salient predictive categories
